This goal saves an image defined in the build configuration to a local file. This is identical to `podman:save`. The name of the container image is calculated based on the full name of the image (including the registry). The resulting file will be a `.tar.gz` file located in the project's `target` directory.

NOTE: This goal is experimental.
